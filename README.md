# NSS Dinosaur WYSIWYG Exercise :: Classwork

### Project Description 

This exercise was a class walk-through of a project-setup, and then the coding of the WYSIWYG functionality using `JQuery` on a dinosaur data set that Zoe had pre-defined for us in a `JSON` file. 

Once the Dinosaur Cards display on the screen, if the user clicks on one to select, its border changes, and the user input field becomes the focus such that, any text entered in that field is mirrored in the bio description in the selected Dinosaur Card.

### Project Specs
Revisited the program functionality of WYSIWYG using `jQuery` on a new data set, walking through the whole coding process together as a class. 

#### Together as a class, we 
- completed the project setup, including installing the `jQuery`, `Bootstrap`, and `Grunt` components in the `lib` directory
- wrote an `ajax` request in `jQuery` to get the `dinosaurs.json` file, then write the data object array to the `dinoArray`, then write the contents of `dinoArray` to the DOM
- wrote `jQuery` event listeners
- wrote the `css` styling

#### Independently, we 
structured the DOM output in the row/column structure, with three dinosaur "cards" per row



### Technologies Used
- `html`
- `css`
- `JavaScript`
- `Bootstrat`
- `jQuery`
- `Grunt`


### How To View The Screen
